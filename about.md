title: About

This is the personal blog of Jonas Juselius. I started programming at the age of
8 on my mothers Olivetti PC, and received my Ph.D. in quantum
chemistry in 2004. For the past 10 years I have been working in
High-Performacne Computing and software development. In 2012 I discovered
functional programming and Haskell. Since
2015 I have been leading the development group at Serit Troms√∏ AS, working full
time with functional programming mostly in F#. I also hold a position at
UiT The Arctic University of Norway, where I teach functional programming at the
Department of Informatics.

For a long time I used to have a nagging feeling that there was something
fundamentally wrong with programming. Programming was reminiscent of mathematics,
but without the kind of rigor one would expect. All rules could be
bent and broken at will. When I discovered functional programming back in 2012,
it had a profound effect on me. All the pieces fell into place, and suddenly
large parts of programming got reconciled with mathematics. This has an
immense effect on code quality, complexity and number of bugs.
Functional programming has long since come of age, and is *not* an academic exercise.

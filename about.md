title: About

This is the personal blog of Jonas Juselius. I started programming at the age of
7 on my mothers Olivetti PC, and received my Ph.D. in quantum
chemistry in 2004. For the past 10 years I have been working in
High-Performace Computing and software developemnt. In 2012 I discovered
funktional programming and Haskell, which had a profound effect on me. Since
2015 I have been leading the development group at Serit Troms√∏, workig fulltime
with full-stack functional programming in F#. I also hold a postition at UiT The
Arctic University of Norway, where I teach functional prgramming at the
Department of Informatics.

I used to have a nagging feeling that there was something wrong with
programming. Programming was remicent of mathematics, but without any kind of
rigor. And all the rules that existed, could be anyway bent and broken at will.
When I discovered fuctional programming back in 2012, it had a profound effect
on me. All the pieces fell into place, and suddenly large parts of programming
got reconciled with matematics.  The mathematical foundation has an immense
effect on code quality, complexity and number of bugs.

Functional programming has come of age, and is not an academic exercise.
For the past eight years I have been working almost exclusively with functional
programming.
